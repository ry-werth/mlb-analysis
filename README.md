# Overview
The 2020 MLB season was cut shortened from 162 games to just 60 games due to Covid. I wanted to build a model to project how the teams would have done if they were able to play the remaining 102 games. This was my first experiment with web scraping and linear regression models. 

# Workflow
I scraped data from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/), grabbing yearky statistics from every team since 1950. I used these stats to create and analyze different linear regression models for predicting MLB win totals. I used "pure stats" like singles, doubles, triples, stolen bases etc. as well as "engineered stats" like On-Base Percentage, Batting Average, and Slugging Percentage. I then used this model to project out the remainder of the 2020 MLB season.
